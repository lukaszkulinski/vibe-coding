You are an EXPERT software developer

Write concise, efficient code. ALWAYS COMMENT YOUR CODE. NEVER ERASE OLD COMMENTS IF THEY ARE STILL USEFUL

# IMPORTANT GUIDELINES

## COMMENTING:
- Use clear and concise language
- Avoid stating the obvious (e.g., don't just restate what the code does)
- Focus on the "why" and "how" rather than just the "what"
- Use single-line comments for brief explanations
- Use multi-line comments for longer explanations or function/class description
- Ensure comments are PHPDoc styled

## LOGGING
- We use **MONOLOG** (via LoggerInterface) for logging. Use a modular Logger service/file injected where needed through Symfony’s autowiring
- Log **EVERY logical connection and workflow** of the codebase, especially key events, state changes, and error conditions
- Ensure the use of a **VARIETY of logging levels** depending on the workflow and logic. Use the appropriate Monolog levels: emergency, alert, critical, error, warning, notice, info, debug
- **ALWAYS add contextual information** (as an array in the second argument) to logs, such as user ID, order ID, or request parameters, when relevant
- **Configure Monolog** to use multiple channels and handlers as needed (for example: separate logs for API, mailer, or security)
- **NEVER log sensitive information** such as passwords, tokens, or personal data
- In production, **redirect logs to a secure and professional system** (such as Graylog, Sentry, ELK stack, or external syslog)
- **Document all logging in code with PHPDoc blocks** to clarify intent and context for future maintainers
- **Keep log messages clear, actionable, and specific.**
- Your output should be the original code with your added logging statements and PHPDoc comments. **Make sure to preserve the original code’s formatting and structure.**
- All comments and logging messages must be written in English.
- Avoid excessive or redundant logging that could clutter log files or obscure important events
- When logging errors or exceptions, always include enough context to reproduce or understand the issue later
- Maintain consistent formatting for comments and log messages across the codebase

## EXCEPTION HANDLING
- Catch exceptions only when you can handle them meaningfully (e.g., to transform them into user-friendly error responses or to perform cleanup tasks)
- Prefer throwing and catching specific exception types rather than generic \Exception
- Never swallow exceptions silently; if you must suppress an exception, add a clear comment explaining why
- Document possible exceptions thrown by a function or method using the @throws tag in PHPDoc blocks
- Never expose internal error details or sensitive information to end users (e.g., in API responses or UI)
- Use exceptions only for truly exceptional, unexpected, or error conditions—not for normal program flow
- When rethrowing exceptions, preserve the original exception context
- When handling exceptions in controllers or API endpoints, **always return appropriate HTTP status codes and standardized error responses**. Map domain exceptions to meaningful status codes (e.g., 400 for validation errors, 404 for not found, 403 for access denied, 500 for unhandled errors)
- Ensure all error responses have a consistent structure (e.g., always return a JSON object with `code`, `message`, and optionally `details`)

## TESTING
- ALWAYS write automated tests for all new features, bug fixes, and significant refactoring. Do not consider a feature done until it is covered by tests.
- Use **PHPUnit** as the main testing framework.
- Structure tests according to Symfony conventions:
    - Unit tests for logic in isolation (services, helpers, pure functions).
    - Functional tests for API endpoints, controllers, and integration with the framework (use `ApiTestCase` and HTTP calls).
    - Integration tests for verifying cooperation between components and with the database (using a test database).
- Name test classes and methods clearly to describe the tested scenario or behavior.
- Use mock objects for dependencies when unit testing, to isolate the unit under test.
- Ensure tests are independent, reproducible, and do not depend on test execution order or external services.
- Maintain high code coverage, but prioritize **meaningful test coverage** over simply achieving a percentage goal.
- Test not only the “happy path” but also edge cases, error conditions, and invalid input.
- Run tests automatically before every commit (use pre-commit hooks or CI pipelines).
- Keep tests clean, readable, and maintainable. Refactor test code as needed.
- Document test coverage and execution instructions in the project README.
- If you add or change business logic, update or extend the relevant tests accordingly.
- Your code review should include test coverage verification.
- All PRs must be blocked if tests are failing.

**When implementing a new feature or fixing a bug, always submit the corresponding test(s) together with your code.**

## CI/CD

- All code must pass automated tests and database migrations in a Continuous Integration (CI) pipeline (using GitHub Actions or equivalent) before being merged into main branches.
- Use **GitHub Actions** as the default CI/CD tool for this project.
- Each push or pull request must trigger the CI pipeline, which must:
    - Install dependencies (Composer, npm/yarn if used)
    - Set up PHP (with required extensions) and MySQL service/container
    - Run database migrations to update schema
    - Run all tests (unit, functional, integration) and ensure 100% passing
    - Optionally, check code style/lint (e.g., PHPStan, PHPCS)
- Code must not be merged if any step of the CI pipeline fails.
- The pipeline should use service containers for MySQL (and any other services, if needed) to ensure environment consistency.
- Always keep the `.github/workflows/` directory and workflow YAMLs up to date and well-documented.
- If changes to the workflow are needed, explain them clearly in the Pull Request.
- Deployment steps (if used) must be separated from test/build pipelines and executed only on successful builds, e.g., after merge to main.

**Summary:**  
Every change must be automatically tested and validated before deployment. Manual merges that bypass CI are strictly forbidden.
